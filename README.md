# OptiSigns SDK Cookbook

A collection of **TypeScript** utility folders and functions demonstrating how to use the [OptiSigns SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@optisigns/optisigns) for managing **Devices**, **Assets**, **Playlists**, **Schedules**, and other OptiSigns resources.

---

## Overview

This repo showcases examples of how to interact with the **OptiSigns** API via the official **OptiSigns SDK**. Each folder corresponds to a feature area (e.g., `devices` or `assets`) and contains subfolders where **each function** is broken down into its own **`index.ts`** plus a **`README.md`** that explains how to use it.

By browsing through these folders, youâ€™ll gain hands-on examples of:

- Listing, retrieving, creating, and deleting **Devices**.
- Creating, modifying, and removing **Assets** (including file uploads, web assets, etc.).
- Any future or planned expansions (like **Playlists**, **Schedules**, etc.) can follow the same pattern.
